2Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard Overview

Clean and modern interface for real-time operations.

Displays quick stats:

Active alerts

Recent uploads

Model performance

Threat summary

Live status indicator for system health and edge device connection.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Center

Users can upload images or video frames from submarines, AUVs, or ROVs.

Accepts multiple formats (JPG, PNG, MP4, etc.).

Shows preview of uploaded content before processing.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Processing Pipeline (Step-by-Step with Next Buttons)

Interactive flow with ‚ÄúNext‚Äù buttons for demonstration:

Step 1: Image Enhancement

Choose Enhancement Model (e.g., CNN, U-Net, GAN).

AI removes haze, corrects colors, and improves contrast.

Outputs an Enhanced Image preview with clarity improvement metrics:

PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)

SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)

UIQM (Underwater Image Quality Measure)

Buttons:
üñºÔ∏è Image Enhancement ‚Üí Generates clear, color-corrected image.

Step 2: Object / Threat Detection

Apply trained YOLOv8 or custom defense model.

Detects potential underwater threats such as:

Submarines

Mines

Drones

Divers

Suspicious objects

Shows:

Threat Type

Confidence Score

Severity Level

Approximate Location (Coordinates)

Enhanced and detected images shown side-by-side for easy comparison.

Buttons:
üéØ Threat Detection ‚Üí Detects and highlights threats.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Reports & Downloads

Generate detailed reports for each processed image/video.

Includes:
